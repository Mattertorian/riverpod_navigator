# Code simplification

Subsequent examples are prepared with simpler code:

- using the functional_widget package simplifies widgets typing
- some code is moved to the common dart file

A modified version of the first example is here: [simple_modified.dart](https://github.com/PavelPZ/riverpod_navigator/blob/main/examples/doc/lib/src/simple_modified.dart).
